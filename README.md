**Disaster Relief and Resource Management Using Generative AI**  

### **üèÜ Award**  
**Major League Hacking Hackathon** - Best Team for Streamlit Innovation

## **Project Overview**  
**Rapid-Relief-AI** is an innovative solution leveraging **generative AI** to optimize and simulate resource allocation in real-time for disaster response scenarios such as:  !

- **Floods**  
- **Wildfires**  
- **Earthquakes**  

The AI provides an efficient **resource distribution plan** for critical supplies, including:  
- Food  
- Water  
- Medical kits  

These plans are generated based on factors like:  
- Disaster severity  
- Location density  
- Infrastructure status  

A demo highlights the potential of **Rapid-Relief-AI** to improve disaster response efficiency.

## **Core Idea**  
This project employs **generative models** to simulate and generate maps or routes for resource allocation. It incorporates real-world constraints, such as:  
- Road access  
- Population distribution  
- Time constraints  

This tool aids agencies in making faster and more effective decisions during emergencies.

## **Setup Instructions**  

### **Step 1: File Organization**  
Ensure all the following files are in the same directory:  
- `main.py`  
- `data_generation.py`  
- `severity_calculation.py`  
- `resource_allocation.py`  
- `dashboard.py`  
- `gan_model.py`  

### **Step 2: Start MongoDB**  
Make sure MongoDB is running before proceeding.

### **Step 3: Train the GAN Model**  
Open a terminal and run:  
```bash
python train_gan.py
